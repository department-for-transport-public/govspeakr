#' Add summary table containing key points of statistical release.
#' Traditionally these consist of key points, images of arrows to indicate
#' direction of change, and detailed description of the key points.
#' This normal structure is produced in word and pdf formats, while the
#' govspeak format includes only the two text columns.
#' The govspeak format also highlights key words indicating direction of
#' change in the description.
#' @param left vector of key points which will appear in left column
#' @param middle optional vector of arrow image calls which will appear
#' in middle column. If not specified, a blank column will be included instead.
#' @param right vector of descriptions of key points which will appear in
#' right column
#' @param key_words vector of key change words to highlight in right column.
#' A preloaded vector of these key words is already included, but
#' additional words can be added as desired.
#' @param key_words_remove character vector of standard key words you would NOT
#' like to highlight in bold (defaults to NULL)
#' @param format string which identifies the outputs you would like
#' three-column table to appear in. Set to HTML as default.
