\usage{
convert_rmd(
  path,
  remove_blocks = FALSE,
  sub_pattern = TRUE,
  page_break = "line"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{string; filename (including path) to *.md file for conversion}

\item{remove_blocks}{bool; decision to remove block elements from *.md file.
This includes code blocks and warnings}

\item{sub_pattern}{bool or vector; decision to increase hashed headers by
one level in *.md file.
  TRUE will substitute all, FALSE will substitute none, while a vector of
  the desired substitution levels allows individual headings to be modified
  as required.
  e.g. "#" will modify only first level headers.}

\item{page_break}{string; chooses what page breaks are converted to on
Whitehall.
If "line", page breaks are replaced with a horizontal rule. If "none"
they are replaced with a line break.
If "unchanged" they are not removed.}

\item{images_folder}{string; folder containing images for *.md file. Defaults
to "graphs"}

\item{img_type}{string; select the type of files searched for in the
images folder.
Default is "all", which returns any type of file
(including hidden system files).
Choosing "images" returns standard image types PNG and SVG only.
Any other string will use regex to return any files with that filetype.}
