\description{
Add summary table containing key points of statistical release.
Traditionally these consist of key points, images of arrows to indicate
direction of change, and detailed description of the key points.
This normal structure is produced in word and pdf formats, while the
govspeak format includes only the two text columns.
The govspeak format also highlights key words indicating direction of
change in the description.
