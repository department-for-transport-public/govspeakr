\description{
Add images which are not auto-generated during the knitting process
to all publishing formats.
All images must be of size 960 x 640 pixels to allow upload to the
Whitehall publishing system, and must be saved with a filename which
starts and ends with sequential numbering.
For example, if the image will be the third graphic in the final
publication, it can be saved as "03-image-1.png".
